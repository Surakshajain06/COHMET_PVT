COHMET (Cognitive and Hand Motor Enhancement Trainer) is a smart, interactive pegboard designed to aid hand coordination and cognitive developmentâ€”especially in stroke rehabilitation settings. It combines visual guidance through LED-lit wells, fixed-colored pegs, and real-time feedback to enhance user engagement. The system is Bluetooth-enabled, with app-based control for tracking progress, timing, and customizable audio prompts.
