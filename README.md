# **CMC COHMET** | ***( Cognitive and Hand Motor Enhancement Trainer )***

COHMET (Cognitive and Hand Motor Enhancement Trainer) is a smart, interactive pegboard designed to aid hand coordination and cognitive development‚Äîespecially in stroke rehabilitation settings. It combines visual guidance through LED-lit wells, fixed-colored pegs, and real-time feedback to enhance user engagement. The system is Bluetooth-enabled, with app-based control for tracking progress, timing, and customizable audio prompts.

## üéØ **Functionality overview**
COHMET offers guided color-matching tasks that help improve motor skills and cognitive responses. Real-time peg placement detection ensures accurate activity tracking and user feedback. Designed with future expandability in mind, including data sync, remote monitoring, and multilingual support.

## üì± **App integration and features**
A companion mobile app allows users or therapists to control sessions, monitor timing, and choose languages (English, Tamil, Hindi). Audio prompts, user tracking, and session customization are planned features under active development. COHMET is built to support scalable digital integration for remote therapy use.

## üì¶ **Physical Design Overview**
COHMET features a compact wooden board with 9 wells and color-coded pegs, making it simple, durable, and user-friendly. Wells are illuminated for visual cues, and components are engineered for intuitive interaction. The system is lightweight and portable, suitable for clinics, therapy centers, or at-home use.

## üîß Future work
 
- Implement a solution to minimize heating in the LED voltage regulator to enhance safety and component life.
- Design a more compact and lightweight version of the device for better portability and ease of use.
- Explore options for cost reduction without compromising on performance or build quality.
- Add audio prompts in three languages (English, Tamil, Hindi) with support for customized voice or sound options.
- Enable customizable timer settings for each well to personalize training intensity and duration.
-Introduce varied game modes including:
        -- Memory game for cognitive recall
        -- Fast-flashing LEDs for reaction training
        -- Keeing different levels of the game based on difficulty level
