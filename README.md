COHMET (Cognitive and Hand Motor Enhancement Trainer) is a smart, colour detection electronic pegboard designed to improve hand coordination and cognitive development for rehabilitation. Unlike traditional pegboards that rely entirely on manual use, COHMET features LED-lighted wells to visually guide the user, fixed-colored pegs for clear matching, and an integrated color detection system that identifies the peg color when placedâ€”enabling accurate tracking of the correctness of color of peg and well. It is Bluetooth-enabled and can be operated through a mobile app , tracking timing, and selecting audio prompts in multiple languages (English, Tamil, Hindi)(not enabled yet in the device). The system is also designed to sync data to a google sheet based Database, making future progress tracking and remote monitoring possible. A clear, beginner-friendly user manual is available to help set up and use the system effectively. Compared to conventional pegboards, COHMET offers a smarter, tech-integrated, and more engaging solution that lays the foundation for interactive therapy and data-driven progress in future versions. This device is the fundamental backbone for various game development like memory based, reaction time based, limited time based, competitive 2 person game etc, just limited by our imagination.
